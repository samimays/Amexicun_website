            <h1>About the Company</h1>
            <p>We have been in the industry for 15+ years. When I started bartending in Houston, 
              I had no idea what was in store for my future. I went back to it after I had taken 
              a job in merchandise management for 5 years. That job didn’t suit my artistic vision 
              nor did it make me happy. When covid-19 hit on March 16th 2020 I was working at 3
               different bars at the time. After the shut down we quarantined for months and all
                I did was cook. I loved cooking but rarely had the time to do it anymore. We also
                 had no money coming in because everything was shut down. Even restaurants! 
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally the law stated in order to open you had to be at 51% in food to open
                  your doors. So I pitched my menu and idea to 3 bars. The Ranch Bar + Kitchen 
                  ran with it because they desperately needed to open. Quickly people noticed we 
                  were not playing around. Dino's Den got on board and we recently have
                   been doing pop-ups in the Heights like Public House Heights HTX...Everyone
                    had always told me that I needed to open my own restaurant one day! NOW I 
                    had time to do it, plus have the opportunity to help get our bars back open. 
                    That “one day” finally came when I had time to lay it all out and focus on 
                    the steps I needed to execute. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This journey has literally been in the 
                    making my whole life. I knew that I could cook, I knew I could plate 
                    and I knew I could deliver customer service to its full potential. 
                    I needed time to cultivate what my vision was, and deliver a product
                     that you could only get from me. Create a fusion that was fun, new,
                      and exciting that represented me. I needed something that would give
                       me a sense of success. Not working for someone else, building their 
                       dream, but building mine. At that point AMEXICUN was born. I felt I was 
                       finally on to something as soon as I created the name. I am thrilled to 
                       say that after the hard work and sleepless nights manifesting my dream, 
                       it is finally a reality. We sold out our very first STEAK NIGHT tonight! 
                       After 4 months of building it! Thank you to everyone for everything you do 
                       for AMEXICUN!  The Support, The Love & The Goodtimes.
                        -God Bless- #gratitude in the #magnitude feeling #accomplished
