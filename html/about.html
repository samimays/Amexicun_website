            <h1>About the Company</h1>
            <p class="abt-paragraphs">The Amexicun team has been in the industry for 15+ years. When the owner,
              Leo Espitia, started bartending in Houston, he had no idea what was in store for 
              his future. He came back to bartending after having a job in merchandise management 
              for 5 years. That job didn’t suit his artistic vision, nor did it make him happy. 
              </p>
            <p class="abt-paragraphs">
              When covid-19 hit on March 16th, 2020, Leo was working at 3 different bars at the time. 
              After the shut down, everyone quarantined for months, but all Leo did was cook. 
              He loved cooking but rarely had the time to do it anymore. 
            </p>
            <p class="abt-paragraphs">
              Finally the law stated in order for bars and restaurants to open, 51% of their profits
              had to come from food to open their doors. This is when Leo decided to pitch his menu 
              and idea to 3 bars. The Ranch Bar + Kitchen ran with it first because they desperately 
              needed to open. Quickly people noticed Leo and his team were not playing around. Dino's 
              Den got on board as well, and they recently have been doing pop-ups in the Heights,
              like Public House Heights HTX. 
            </p>
            <p class="abt-paragraphs">
              Many people in Leo's life always told him that he needed to open his own restaurant
              one day. Now, he had time to, plus has the opportunity to help get our bars
              neighborhood bars back open! That “one day” finally came when he had time to 
              lay it all out and focus on the steps needed to execute his dream. 
            </p>
            <p class="abt-paragraphs">
              Leo states that his journey has literally been in the making his whole life. 
              He knew that he could cook, plate, and deliver customer service to its full
              potential. He needed time to cultivate his vision, and deliver a product
              that was unique to him. Create a fusion that was fun, new, and exciting that 
              represented him. He needed something that would give him a sense of succes: 
              not working for someone else, but building his own dream. At that point AMEXICUN 
              was born. He felt he was finally on to something as soon as hecreated the name. 
            </p>
            <p class="abt-paragraphs">
              After the hard work and sleepless nights manifesting his dream, he is thrilled 
              to say it is finally a reality! The Amexicun team sold out their very first 
              STEAK NIGHT after just 4 months of building it!
            </p>
            <p class="abt-paragraphs">
              The team is thankful for everyone and everything they do 
              for AMEXICUN! Showing their love, support, and creating good memories!
            </p>
